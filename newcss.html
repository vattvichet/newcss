    <h1>How to be Matture</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        <b>Develop your interests.</b> <a href="about.com">HAHAHA</a> Lacking dynamic or developed interests or hobbies
        might
        contribute to your seeming
        immature.
        Finding something that you enjoy doing and becoming an "expert" at it can make you seem more experienced and
        mature.
        It will also give you something to talk about with others, whether or not they also participate in your hobby.
    </p>

    <p>

        Set goals and work towards them. Part of maturity is being able to assess your current strengths, determine
        areas
        that you need to improve, and set goals for the future. Keep the future in mind and let it inform the choices
        you
        are making about your life right now. Once you have set goals that are clear, actionable, and measurable, take
        action to work towards them

        Set goals and work towards them. Part of maturity is being able to assess your current strengths, determine
        areas
        that you need to improve, and set goals for the future. Keep the future in mind and let it inform the choices

        Setting goals can seem overwhelming, but don’t worry! It just takes a little time and planning. Start by
        figuring
        out what really matters to you—what do you value, and what do you want to do next in your life? From there, you
        can
        figure out the steps you need to take to get where you want to be.[5]
        First you need to think about a few categories: Who, What, When, Where, How, and Why.
        Who. This is who will be involved in achieving your goals. Obviously, you are the primary person here. However,
        this
        category could also include a tutor, a volunteer coordinator, or a counselor.
        What. What do you want to achieve? It’s important to be as specific as possible in this step. “Prepare for
        college”
        is way too big. You’ll never get started on a huge vague goal like that. Instead, choose a few specifics that
        will
        help you achieve that bigger goal, like “Do a volunteer activity” and “Participate in an extracurricular
        activity.”
        When. This helps you know when specific parts of your plan have to be done. Knowing this will help keep you on
        track. For example, if you want to volunteer, you need to know if there’s a deadline to apply, when the
        activities
        are, and when you’ll be able to do them.
